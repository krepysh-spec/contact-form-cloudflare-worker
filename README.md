## Why Use Resend for Email?

Resend is a simple, fast, and free email API service designed to make sending transactional emails, such as contact form submissions, incredibly easy. It allows you to quickly send emails without the need to worry about setting up or maintaining your own email servers.

### **Resend Free Tier Features**:
- **100 emails per day** (Daily Limit)
- **3,000 emails per month** (Monthly Limit)
- **4 sender addresses** available for use
- **No credit card required** to get started

This repository contains a **serverless function** that processes contact form submissions. It validates the input data and sends an email via **Resend**, making it a simple, efficient, and cost-free solution for handling contact forms.

## How It Works

This Cloudflare Worker:
1. Accepts `POST` requests with form data in JSON format.
2. Validates the provided input (name, email, phone, subject, message).
3. Sends an email via **Resend API**.
4. Returns a JSON response confirming success or showing validation errors.
